        <h1>How long have I photographed and what got me into it?</h1>
         <p>I have always been artistic and felt most myself in the nature. I have been
            hikig for couple of years now, and I have constantly been amazed by our beautiful nature.
            I started my photography journey by capturing the views with my phone while hiking. Slowly I got
            more interested in editing, and paying more attention to the techinal side of photographing.
            I find photographing and editing highly therapeutical during a hectic and stressfull time in my life.
            A year ago I bought my first camera and since then I have been spending my freetime capturing
            beautiful scenes and moments</p>
